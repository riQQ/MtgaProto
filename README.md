# MtgaProto
This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow to extract the protocol buffer definitions (.proto) from the Magic: The Gathering Arena (MTGA) setup and commit it.

As of now, the protobuf definitions are contained in the file `Wizards.MDN.GreProtobuf.Unity.dll`. This file is part of the MTGA setup.

The current version information used by the MTGA update mechanism can be found at
